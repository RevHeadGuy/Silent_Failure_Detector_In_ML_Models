# 🔍 Silent Failure Detector

A production-style machine learning monitoring system designed to detect silent failures in ML models by tracking prediction drift, feature drift, and behavioral degradation over time — without relying on immediate labels.

The system combines statistical drift detection, severity classification, alerting, and an interactive dashboard to ensure long-term model reliability.
